# Evolved Chess
Evolved Chess is a fun variant of chess where the pieces evolve over with takedowns. 
This project was our entry to the Hackathon hosted by BBD Software, where we took second place.

See it live [here](https://kivalm.github.io/EvolutionChess)

## Tools
This project is made up of two key parts.
1. The SvelteKit frontend - used for rendering and handling UI logic
2. The Rust backend - where we use a chess engine to do the (blazingly fast) computing for the AI.

It is also a PWA, so you can install it locally if you wish.

## Development
    1. `npm install` -> to install dependencies
    2. `npm run dev` -> to start the development server
    3. `npm run build` -> to build the project
    4. `npm run deploy` -> to deploy the project to GitHub Pages
